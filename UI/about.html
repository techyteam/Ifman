                        <p class="mb-30">
                            In Nigeria, after over three (3) decades since the attainment of our national independence,
                            some concerned new generation practitioners in facility management got together in Lagos 
                            in 1995 and founded IFMA of Nigeria. The group of facility management professionals came 
                            together to initiate and establish a Nigeria Chapter of the International Facility Management 
                            Association, IFMA, it was first and foremost born out of the desire to provide Nigeria with 
                            the opportunity of developing a maintenance culture that will shape the future of the country.
                            <br><br>
                            Subscribing to Mobil’s cliché that it ‘’takes courageous leadership to admit that we must improve
                            our quality’’ these multi-disciplined professionals in Mobil, Chevron and others propose setting
                            up our quality improvement goals aimed at bringing the international standards of facility 
                            management to bear on maintenance of infrastructure in Nigeria.
